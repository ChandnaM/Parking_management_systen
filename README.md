# Parking_management_systen


The project report presents IOT-based smart parking system. The IR sensors used detect the presence of vehicle on the provided spot. A set of user-defined programs have been used providing instruction in Arduino IDE to do the same. IoT is the combination of collecting and exchanging data from electronic hardware to the cloud platform and sharing with the software linked. Blynk platform is used to reflect the presence or absence of vehicles in the spot.
